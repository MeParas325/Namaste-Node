# LibUV and Event Loop in Node.js

## LibUV Overview
LibUV is a multi-platform support library used in Node.js to handle asynchronous I/O operations. It provides the following key components:

1. **Event Loop**: Manages asynchronous operations and callbacks.
2. **Callback Queues**: Holds callbacks for different phases of the event loop.
3. **Thread Pool**: Handles expensive operations (e.g., file I/O, DNS lookups) outside the main thread.

## Event Loop in Node.js

The event loop is the core mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations. It consists of **4 main phases**, each with its own **callback queue**:

### Phases of the Event Loop
1. **Timers Phase**:
   - Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.
   - Checks if any timers have expired and runs their callbacks.

2. **Poll Phase**:
   - Retrieves new I/O events and executes their callbacks.
   - If no I/O events are pending, it will wait here until the next timer expires or a new event is detected.

3. **Check Phase**:
   - Executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate()`.

4. **Close Phase**:
   - Executes callbacks for close events (e.g., `socket.on('close', ...)`).

---

### Execution Flow
- Before moving to any phase, the event loop checks for **`process.nextTick()`** and **`Promise.resolve()`** callbacks.
  - These callbacks are executed immediately due to their **high priority**.
  - `process.nextTick()` has a **higher priority** than `Promise.resolve()`.
- If multiple `process.nextTick()` calls are nested within each other, they will all be executed before moving to the next phase.

---

### Key Points
1. **Priority Queues**:
   - `process.nextTick()` and `Promise.resolve()` have their own **priority queues**.
   - `process.nextTick()` callbacks are executed before `Promise.resolve()` callbacks.

2. **Idle State**:
   - When the event loop is idle (no pending callbacks or timers), it waits in the **poll phase** for new events.

3. **Browser vs. Node.js Event Loop**:
   - The event loop in Node.js is different from the one in browsers. Node.js uses LibUV, while browsers use their own implementations.

4. **Nested `nextTick()` Calls**:
   - If multiple `process.nextTick()` calls are nested, they are executed in sequence due to their high priority, potentially delaying other phases.

---

### Example Execution Flow
1. Execute `process.nextTick()` and `Promise.resolve()` callbacks.
2. Move to the **Timers Phase** and execute expired timer callbacks.
3. Move to the **Poll Phase** and execute I/O callbacks.
4. Move to the **Check Phase** and execute `setImmediate()` callbacks.
5. Move to the **Close Phase** and execute close event callbacks.
6. Repeat the cycle.
